Methods of generating discrete functions from a list of points.

Given a list of points (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) and initial value
y_0, a discrete function built from these points will be defined as
follows:

f(x) = y_0      if x < x_1
f(x) = y_k      if x_1 <= x < x_n where x_k <= x < x_(k+1)
f(x) = y_n      if x >= x_n
